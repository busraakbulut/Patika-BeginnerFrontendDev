                <h2>Bulldogs</h2>
                <p>The Bulldog was originally used to drive cattle to market and to compete in a bloody sport called bullbaiting. Today, they’re gentle companions who love kids. Even though these are purebred dogs, you may find them in the care of shelters
                    or rescue groups. Remember to adopt! Don’t shop if you want to bring a dog home.</p>
