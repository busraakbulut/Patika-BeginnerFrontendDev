Step 1: Divide into 2 different part by looking at upper bound and lower bound We can do this with (0+5)/2 =2.5 and we will take 3 numbers for one half and 3 numbers for another half
16	21	11

8	12	22

Step 2: Take the first part and divide again (0+2)/2 =1 
16	21
11

11
Step 3: It will divide until it has only one element 
16
21

Step 4: It will do the same things for other half
22

8
12

Step 5: It is finished the divide part now it will skip the merge part. Fist it will merge the lower bound to mid which is first part.
11	16	21

Step 6: Merge other half.
8	12	22

Step 7: To complete the sorting process merge all together.
8	11	12	16	21	22

b) time complexity: Every time when it divides it cuts other half which means 2^x=n => x = logn and it happens n times. So the time complexity is O(nlogn)
