Start with selecting root.

Root =7
As we know if the next number is bigger than root. It will right as right child. If it is smaller, it will right as left child.


7->5 we will write it to left child
1=> it is smaller than 7 and there is a node there which is 5 and it is even smaller than 5 so we will put it 5’s left child.
8=> It is bigger than 7 so it will put it 7’s right child.
3 => 1’s right child
6=> 5’s right child
0=> 1’s left child
9=> 8’s right child
4=> 3’s right child
2=> 3’s left child
